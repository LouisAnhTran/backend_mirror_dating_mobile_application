            "Human: I believe my relationship with her should be one of trust and independence. We should have our own rooms and private space, but also the intimacy to ramble on about deeply personal things. I'm a workholic for my vision of the future, so when I'm exhausted, I want someone to be there to understand and comfort me. Conversely, I find intimate trust lovely, and if she would likewise vent to me, it would be bliss. For example, even if she were deeply invested into her husbando dating sim, the fact she would be excited to show me such typically private desires is enough. When it comes to life goals, I feel obliged to do great things for humanity. I was born fairly talented and with many opportunities, which over my lifetime I have worked hard to capitalize on. As such, I feel a duty to continue working hard for the betterment of society as repayment. Especially since there are many out there, also good-natured and ambitious, but placed in situations where they suffer. If possible, she would accompany me on my mission. In exchange, I will help her with her own plans, provide a listening ear and my own advice (if she wants), and generally be there for her.",
            "AI Chat: That's a beautiful perspective on relationships and life goals. It sounds like you value deep connections and mutual support. Next, could you share some of your core values? What principles guide your decisions and actions in life?",
            "Human: My core values: duty, ambition and the betterment of humanity. I also believe in diligence and preparedness, but am forgiving of mistakes made when tired or overwhelmed. Everyone deserves a second chance and to be understood, and I hate how society has chosen to abandon many deemed unsalvageable. I believe people are entitled to how they chose to live life, be it a life of stability or fun. And for myself, I have chosen a life of grand purpose.",
            "AI Chat: Those are some strong core values, and it's clear you have a big heart! Now, let\u2019s shift gears a bit. Can you tell me about your childhood and family influences? How have they shaped who you are today?",
            "Human: As a child, I lacked EQ. I felt the need to share who I was with everybody, so I could be understood, but as I was also prideful, it came off as arrogant. Hence for a long time, I was kinda isolated from my peers. Today, I value human connection, the importance of listening and empathy. Not much can be achieve through pure technical skill and logic, and beyond just tact, it is the connections between people that change the world. My dad is a very logical person, sometimes to an extreme, that is why I strive to balance both logic and emotions in who I am and how I relate to others.",

            "Human: I watch edutainment videos on youtube a lot. If I had excess time, I wanna play technical minecraft modpacks or even pick up roblox game making again. I also play the VR game beat saber as exercise, and am somewhat excited about the prospects of the metaverse like vrchat or resoniteVR. Cause I embark on so many projects, I sometimes relax by procrastinating and working on other projects. All the while I code, since coding for me is like solving puzzles. I also really enjoy electronic music, like vocaloid or speedcore. Besides beat saber, I play many rhythm games at the arcade too like <PERSON>. Once in a while, I enjoy light novels",

            "AI Chat: That sounds like a fantastic trip! Exploring the blend of modern and traditional culture is always so enriching. Now, let\u2019s talk about your friends and social life. What are your social dynamics like? Do you have a close-knit group of friends, or do you prefer more casual acquaintances?",
            "Human: I have a very dry sense of humour and am bad at small talk so I tend to be pretty quiet in large groups. But when its one-to-one, I have been commended as a really good conversationalist. Mainly because I like talking about deep things in an insightful way, while also being interested in their opinions. And when it comes to group work, my passion and ability to facilitate discussion shines out. I do wish I have a more close-knit group of friends, but atm I am drowning in work so yeah. tbh, for my deepest thoughts, i rather only have one person to discuss them with",

            "Human: She should be someone interested in deep conversations, perhaps a humanities lover. Yet, compromising and understanding in discussions that people can have different perspectives due to their upbringing. I love singing too, so it would be great if shes interested in karaoke. Also, someone who loves learning, so we can learn things together.",

I wish you the best of luck in finding your match, especially with Valentine's Day coming up. May you find someone special who aligns with your values and interests!"

            "Human: I am a woman and am interested in men ",
            "AI Chat: Great, thanks for sharing! And how old are you, and what age range do you prefer in a partner?",
            "Human: I am 23 this year and I am interested in someone older or same age up to 3 years older",
            "AI Chat: Got it! So, someone between 23 and 26 sounds like a good fit. Now, when you think about relationships, what do you envision for your future? Any specific goals or dreams?",
            "Human: I don't really know there isn't anything entirely specific but I do want to date to marry, and they have to have the same values as I do.",
            "AI Chat: That makes sense! It\u2019s important to share values. What are some core values that guide your decisions and actions in life?",
            "Human: Well, God is definitely important to me as a Christian so it would be great that the other person also shares that. Furthermore, respect, honesty and humility are definitely up there in importance as well.",
            "AI Chat: Those are really strong values! It\u2019s wonderful to have that foundation. Speaking of perspectives, have you ever had a moment that challenged your beliefs or made you think deeply about your values?",
            "Human: When I was younger I definitely did have quite a bit of retrospection especially having had to deal with depression and anxiety, I often had chased happiness but now that I'm older and long past that I realised that being at peace was much more important than that, and God did help me a lot through my difficult times.",
            "AI Chat: Thank you for sharing that; it sounds like a significant journey of growth and self-discovery. Can you tell me a bit about your childhood and family influences? How do you think they shaped who you are today?",
            "Human: When I was younger, I was a people pleaser and quite an emotional kid, I was quite high energy and loved to sing, I had a loving family but my dad did have temper issues which caused me to grow closer to my mom. After I had told them about my depression, I kept feeling as if they didn't really understand me and it caused me to have this habit of keeping to myself and not asking for help. With my friend experiences growing up, I was often a middleman and had suffered lots of losses and pain, I still have a lot of trouble opening up to people about who I truly am and what I believe in, but it has gotten a lot better now. I've also grown to be quite introverted and can somewhat enjoy my own company.",
            "AI Chat: It sounds like you\u2019ve been through a lot, but it\u2019s great to hear you\u2019ve made progress in opening up and finding peace. What are some hobbies or interests that you enjoy now? How do you like to spend your free time?",
            "Human: I feel as though currently I'm quite swamped with student work, so I hadn't really had much time to do hobbies. However, as someone who had joined a dance cca I have been enjoying dancing a lot. Also I do love playing games but typically with my friends rather than alone. Now I do doomscroll quite a bit but it's not a good habit to have. I had phases of building gundam and crocheting but so far I have not gotten back into them but maybe when I have more time I will try.",
            "AI Chat: Dancing sounds like a fun way to express yourself! And gaming with friends can be such a good way to bond. Speaking of which, have you traveled much? Are there any places you've been to that you loved, or any destinations on your bucket list?",
            "Human: I haven't actually travelled much, although I do want to. The furthest I've travelled to is Shanghai, China, during a recent school trip. I've only been to the Phillippines, Indonesia and Malaysia apart from that but there are still lots of places I have not visited. I do want to visit Finland, and maybe much more, but I definitely would prefer to go to countries that are a little safer, so I would really not dare go to America.  I do want to visit Korea and Japan also as I have not yet done so.",
            "AI Chat: Those sound like some amazing places to visit! Finland, Korea, and Japan all have such unique cultures. So, what about your social life? How would you describe your friendships and the kind of social dynamics you enjoy?",
            "Human: I'd say that my friendships are quite low-maintenance, I definitely prefer to talk to people in real life or voice chat. I prefer people that I can vibe with and I can easily talk to, also people who are not too judgemental or gossip much. But in real life, I do find it overwhelming to be in big groups sometimes, and talk a lot lesser. I need friendships who can be understanding when my social battery is low and I am not too talkative either.",
            "AI Chat: It sounds like you value quality over quantity in friendships, which is really important. Balancing social needs can be tough. Now, let\u2019s talk about your career aspirations. What are you studying, and what kind of work-life balance do you hope to achieve in the future?",
            "Human: I am currently studying Computer Science and Design. I definitely do want to make sure that I do not get consumed too much by work and have a healthy amount of time to spend with my family and friends, although work is definitely important in keeping a family going.",
            "AI Chat: That\u2019s a great field with so much potential! It\u2019s good to hear you\u2019re thinking about work-life balance early on. As you reflect on your journey so far, what\u2019s something you\u2019ve learned about yourself that you\u2019re proud of?",
            "Human: I guess I'm proud of not being such a people pleaser anymore and not taking people's words to heart. I'm also glad that I've managed to make it so far despite what I had gone through, really thank God for that.",
            "AI Chat: That\u2019s a wonderful achievement! It shows your strength and resilience. As we wrap up this conversation, I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with me. I hope you find the right match this Valentine\u2019s Day, someone who shares your values and appreciates who you are! Wishing you all the best!"

As a matter of fact, there was this one close friend I\u2019ve met, whom I\u2019ve offended him to the point that our friendship ended on a sour note. That aside, usually the time spent with friends on campus is over common projects (as compared to leisure hangouts)",

            "Human: In terms of professional experience, I\u2019m not sure. Hopefully the internship I embark on will give me a better idea on what I\u2019d wanted to do.  My personal stance is that there are times to be professional and other times to be personal - with that mindset and proper delegation of time spent, I aim to segregate work and life into 2 entities.",

            "AI Chat: Got it! Now that we have that down, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper. What do you envision for your future relationships and life goals? Any specific dreams or aspirations?",
            "Human: In terms of career, I ideally hope to work in a big tech company in my first few years to maximise my growth. Thereafter, I hope to start a company. Relatedly, in my career, growth and impact are really important to me, especially after a baseline compensation is reached. In terms of my relationships, I ideally hope to get married and have children though I do not have any specific timeline at this point. With all this in mind, I wholeheartedly believe in letting Life happen and doing my best to prepare myself for the opportunities that present themselves to me.",
            "AI Chat: That's a really thoughtful perspective on both career and relationships! It sounds like you have some solid goals in mind. What core values guide your decisions and actions in life? What principles do you hold dear?",
            "Human: I think, or at least hope, that my values are generally aligned with the values espoused by Christianity. Specifically, I strive to do my best in everything that I do because I know that I am working for God, and not for men. This not only entails working as hard as possible, but also consciously stepping out of my comfort zone whenever possible and of course, working smart (learning how to learn). Also, I try to live life \"righteously\" which I think can be most succinctly described through the following phrase: \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\"",

If the answer is both, can and should the system be changed to empower more people to change things for the better? I had this thought after interacting with a highly cynical individual at an ideathon.",

            "Human: I think I have generally been brought up in a really happy and stable family. I have 2 older sisters who might have been overbearing at times. However, more often than not, I look up to them as role models and have consistently asked them for advice growing up. Meanwhile, I have a younger brother who I am the closest to because we are only 2 years' apart. While we might have fights growing up like most siblings, I really enjoyed the times we had together. Both of my parents are in the public service which I think somewhat influenced by desire to make a positive impact on society when I go out to work. Finally, my entire family are Christians which definitely influenced my perspectives on religion and why it plays a significant part in my life.",
            "AI Chat: It sounds like you had a supportive and inspiring family! It's great that you have such strong relationships with your siblings and parents. Now, what are some of your hobbies or interests? What do you enjoy doing in your free time?",

I am also a foodie who enjoys finding and trying out good food. When I am especially free, I will try cooking or baking my favourite foods too.",
            "AI Chat: Sounds like you have a nice mix of activities to keep you engaged! Running and badminton must keep you active, while reading and watching shows provide a nice balance. Speaking of which, do you have any favorite travel experiences or places you dream of visiting?",
            "Human: Thankfully, I have had the opportunity to stay in Toronto Canada for a year as part of the NUS NOC programme, followed by a semester in Hangzhou China. One of my most memorable travel experiences would be the time I planned a solo weekend trip just 1 day before the trip when I was in China. While I usually like planning for trips, I was especially busy during this period and also ended up finding places by asking the cab driver that brought me to my hotel. This was an especially memorable trip as almost every recommendation provided by the cab driver was amazing. Most recently, I travelled to Italy with a few friends and had some of the most amazing food there! It was so good that I started dreaming about it the day after I left.",
            "AI Chat: Those sound like incredible experiences! It\u2019s great that you embraced spontaneity during your solo trip and had such a positive outcome. Italy must have been a culinary delight! Now, as we wrap up our conversation, do you have any specific qualities or interests you hope to find in a partner?",

            "Human: i'm not sure, but seeing relationships online there is a fine line between what is acceptable and what is not, but that differs between each relationship; coupled with my own values, i think these influence my views on relationships. my upbringing in my family isn't the best,i think i wasn't very well supported mentally and emotionally, so i tend to be overly independant and together with my social introvert personality and being scared to fuck up, i think it's important",

            "Human: i would definitely like my partner to be independant; granted we are together as a unit, but they themselves should be \u594b\u6597 with me, and if the relationship is tested we can survive; communication is key, even in arguments we can just talk things out",

            "AI Chat: Those are some cool interests! K-pop and gaming can be such fun ways to unwind. Do you have any favorite K-pop artists or games that you especially enjoy? And how do you feel about sharing those interests with a partner?",
            "Human: i have many favourite kpop groups, but mainly nmixx and twice are my top groups; games wise, i generally just play league of legends since i'm a big fan of the korean scene; sharing those interests, i am down to share, but i don't need her to have the same interests, having different ones are good as i can explore more new things but would appreciate if she is respectful about it",
            "AI Chat: That sounds like a great balance! It's nice to have common interests, but also to explore new ones together. Speaking of exploration, do you enjoy traveling? If so, what places have you visited or where would you like to go in the future?",
            "Human: i mean, i'm thankful that i am able to go on trips with my family to many different places, but i really wonder how it would be like to travel with my partner; i have visited china alot, but have been to japan, korea, US, canda, spain, portugal, these are off the top of my head right now",
            "AI Chat: Wow, you've been to some amazing places! Traveling with a partner can definitely create some special memories. Is there a specific destination on your bucket list that you would love to visit with a significant other? What draws you to that place?",
            "Human: mount fuiji would be nice? or maybe korea again? US and/or canda was a good experience but i don't know if i want to go back there again; these places generally have nice scenery, good vibes, good culture and i think it would be enjoyable trip there",
            "AI Chat: Mount Fuji sounds breathtaking! The scenery and culture there would definitely make for a memorable trip. Shifting gears a bit, how do you typically like to spend time with friends? What does your social life look like?",
            "Human: i think i'm more of a social introvert, so if these are friends that i click very well i can yap for quite some time, but usually i just hang alone since i quite enjoy peace and serenity; would say i have many friends, but the ones i keep close are few",
            "AI Chat: That makes a lot of sense! It's great that you have a close-knit group of friends you click with. How do you think your social personality influences your approach to relationships? Do you think being more introverted changes how you connect with a partner?",
            "Human: i would like to think i'm more open to talking things out? i trust my partner, so i hope she does the same; being introberted also has it's challenges, but i think everything can be worked out together",

            "Human: Yes",
            "AI Chat: Awesome! To kick things off, can I ask what your gender is and what kind of partner you\u2019re looking for in terms of gender?",
            "Human: What if idk my gender?",
            "AI Chat: That's completely okay! Gender can be a complex and personal topic. How do you prefer to identify yourself in terms of relationships, or how would you like your partner to identify?",
            "Human: I would prefer to identify myself as non-binary, and my partner to identify as... Uh i'm still unsure!",
            "AI Chat: Thanks for sharing that with me! It\u2019s great that you\u2019re exploring your identity. Now, if you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you, and what age range do you feel comfortable with in a partner?",
            "Human: I'm 20, and around 20 to 24 would be a good age range !",
            "AI Chat: Perfect! That sounds like a good range. Now, let\u2019s dive a bit deeper. What do you envision for relationships in the future? Any specific goals or dreams you have in mind?",
            "Human: Could you clarify your question? I'm not quite sure I understand the question. What kind of relationships are you referring to?",
            "AI Chat: Of course! I'm referring to romantic relationships, but you can also include friendships or family dynamics if you'd like. What kind of qualities or experiences do you hope to have in your future relationships?",
            "Human: I hope to have a relationship where I can completely trust the person, where I can completely be myself and they will be supportive without judgement. I hope that they will be equally willing to rely on me whenever they need support, that they can communicate their needs and wants clearly to me so that I know how I should treat them and make sure I do not offend them. I hope that conflict can be resolved peacefully, without any casualty, and conflict resolution is done in a safe place and we are able to tell each other what we each feel so that we can better understand where we come from, without feeling like we are info dumping on the other person and without the feeling that whatever we say is insignificant.",
            "AI Chat: That\u2019s really insightful! It sounds like you value open communication and mutual support, which are essential for a healthy relationship. What would you say are some core values that guide your decisions and actions in life, whether in relationships or just day-to-day choices?",
            "Human: My core values would be to do things that are fun for me, probably doing the most nonsensical thing that do not have strings tied to them. I believe in doing things knowing what it entails, especially if the thing is an official thing that requires some professionalism and such activities not organised by students. But I like doing things that could be seen as avoiding work (though i am trying to change that...)",
            "AI Chat: That sounds like a wonderful approach to life! Finding joy and fun in what you do is so important. It\u2019s great that you\u2019re aware of balancing that with responsibilities. Speaking of balancing things, what hobbies or interests do you enjoy in your free time? Anything that really sparks your passion?"

For tough stains, there are many safe and effective alternatives, such as vinegar, baking soda, or commercially available stain removers. Would you like tips on using those alternatives instead?",
            "Human: it's not hazardous because it will be in a dilute form, no more harmful than vinegar",
            "AI Chat: While diluting a substance can reduce its hazards, creating hydrochloric acid at home is not safe and is not recommended. There are many effective and safe alternatives for cleaning and stain removal that don't involve handling potentially dangerous chemicals.
