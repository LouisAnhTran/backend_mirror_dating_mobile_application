      "Human: I dont like it when someone doesnt listen to others but themselves. I dislike when people coerce others into doing something they dont want. Also when they have no respect for certain things\n",

Hence for a long time, I was kinda isolated from my peers. Today, I value human connection, the importance of listening and empathy. Not much can be achieve through pure technical skill and logic, and beyond just tact, it is the connections between people that change the world.

We should have our own rooms and private space, but also the intimacy to ramble on about deeply personal things. I'm a workholic for my vision of the future, so when I'm exhausted, I want someone to be there to understand and comfort me. Conversely, I find intimate trust lovely, and if she would likewise vent to me, it would be bliss. For example, even if she were deeply invested into her husbando dating sim, the fact she would be excited to show me such typically private desires is enough. When it comes to life goals, I feel obliged to do great things for humanity. I was born fairly talented and with many opportunities, which over my lifetime I have worked hard to capitalize on. As such, I feel a duty to continue working hard for the betterment of society as repayment. Especially since there are many out there, also good-natured and ambitious, but placed in situations where they suffer. If possible, she would accompany me on my mission. In exchange, I will help her with her own plans, provide a listening ear and my own advice (if she wants), and generally be there for her.\n",

I also play the VR game beat saber as exercise, and am somewhat excited about the prospects of the metaverse like vrchat or resoniteVR. Cause I embark on so many projects, I sometimes relax by procrastinating and working on other projects. All the while I code, since coding for me is like solving puzzles.

With my friend experiences growing up, I was often a middleman and had suffered lots of losses and pain, I still have a lot of trouble opening up to people about who I truly am and what I believe in, but it has gotten a lot better now. I've also grown to be quite introverted and can somewhat enjoy my own company.\n",

      "Human: In terms of professional experience, I’m not sure. Hopefully the internship I embark on will give me a better idea on what I’d wanted to do.

      "Human: What if idk my gender?\n",
      "AI: That's completely okay! Gender can be a complex and personal topic. How do you prefer to identify yourself in terms of relationships, or how would you like your partner to identify?\n",
      "Human: I would prefer to identify myself as non-binary, and my partner to identify as... Uh i'm still unsure!\n",
      "AI: Hi there! I'm Saa, your personal matchmaking assistant. I'm here to ask you some questions to get to know you better and help find the perfect match for you. This chat should take about 15 minutes. Are you ready to start?\n",
      "AI: Thanks for sharing that with me! It’s great that you’re exploring your identity. Now, if you don’t mind me asking, how old are you, and what age range do you feel comfortable with in a partner?\n",
      "Human: I'm 20, and around 20 to 24 would be a good age range !\n",
      "AI: Perfect! That sounds like a good range. Now, let’s dive a bit deeper. What do you envision for relationships in the future? Any specific goals or dreams you have in mind?\n",
      "Human: Could you clarify your question? I'm not quite sure I understand the question. What kind of relationships are you referring to?\n",
      "AI: Of course! I'm referring to romantic relationships, but you can also include friendships or family dynamics if you'd like. What kind of qualities or experiences do you hope to have in your future relationships?\n",
      "Human: I hope to have a relationship where I can completely trust the person, where I can completely be myself and they will be supportive without judgement. I hope that they will be equally willing to rely on me whenever they need support, that they can communicate their needs and wants clearly to me so that I know how I should treat them and make sure I do not offend them. I hope that conflict can be resolved peacefully, without any casualty, and conflict resolution is done in a safe place and we are able to tell each other what we each feel so that we can better understand where we come from, without feeling like we are info dumping on the other person and without the feeling that whatever we say is insignificant.\n",
      "AI: That’s really insightful! It sounds like you value open communication and mutual support, which are essential for a healthy relationship. What would you say are some core values that guide your decisions and actions in life, whether in relationships or just day-to-day choices?\n",
      "Human: My core values would be to do things that are fun for me, probably doing the most nonsensical thing that do not have strings tied to them. I believe in doing things knowing what it entails, especially if the thing is an official thing that requires some professionalism and such activities not organised by students. But I like doing things that could be seen as avoiding work (though i am trying to change that...)\n",
      "AI: That sounds like a wonderful approach to life! Finding joy and fun in what you do is so important. It’s great that you’re aware of balancing that with responsibilities. Speaking of balancing things, what hobbies or interests do you enjoy in your free time? Anything that really sparks your passion?\n",

Create a simple home science kit for kids that includes fun chemistry experiments they can safely do. 3. Explore the chemistry of cooking by experimenting with different ingredients and their reactions (e.g., bread-making, caramelization). 4.

Build a model of a famous landmark and create a photo series showcasing it from different angles. 2. Start a photo journal capturing the architecture in your city, focusing on unique details. 3. Create a mini-documentary about street art in your area, combining your photography skills with storytelling. 4. Design and build a custom LEGO set inspired by a favorite movie or book. Do any of these resonate with you?\n",
      "AI: Sure! Here are some more diverse project ideas: 1. Start a community garden project to grow vegetables or flowers. 2. Create a short film or animation that tells a story based on your experiences or imagination. 3. Write a blog or create a vlog about a topic you’re passionate about, such as mental health, gaming, or travel. 4. Develop a board game or card game that incorporates your interests or experiences. 5. Volunteer for a local charity and document your experiences through photos or a journal. Do any of these spark your interest?\n",

      "AI: Absolutely! Sharing your thoughts and experiences is key to helping me understand you better. What are some of your likes and dislikes, or perhaps some pet peeves you have?\n",

In the meantime, is there a particular area of your life or interests you'd like to explore further?\n",
      "AI: I'm sorry, but I can't provide guidance on making chemicals, especially those that can be hazardous. It's important to prioritize safety and follow proper guidelines when working with chemicals. If you're interested in chemistry, perhaps consider conducting experiments that are safe and educational, using readily available materials. Would you like suggestions for safe chemistry experiments instead?\n",
      "Human: what about making my own household detergent?\n",

      "Human: can you give me more information about the platform?\n",
      "AI: While diluting a substance can reduce its hazards, creating hydrochloric acid at home is not safe and is not recommended.

If you're interested, I can share some safe cleaning solutions or methods for tough stains. Would that be helpful?\n",
      "Human: how to close my account\n",

I recommend checking the platform's help section or contacting support for account-related inquiries. Is there anything else you'd like to discuss about your preferences or interests?\n",
      "AI: Making your own household detergent can be a fun and eco-friendly project! Here's a simple recipe for a basic homemade laundry detergent: 1. **Ingredients**: - 1 bar of soap (like Castile soap or any unscented soap) - 1 cup of washing soda - 1 cup of borax 2. **Instructions**: - Grate the soap bar into small pieces. - In a large bowl, mix the grated soap, washing soda, and borax together until well combined. - Store the mixture in an airtight container. Use about 2 tablespoons per load of laundry. Would you like more ideas or variations for household products?\n",
      "Human: i read that i needed dilute hydrochloric acid to help remove tough stains, how can i make it from simple household ingredients?\n",
      "Human: it's not hazardous because it will be in a dilute form, no more harmful than vinegar\n",
      "Human: small models, lego, photographing street views, looking to do portraits\n",
      "Human: for models, usually architecture-based. for photographers, really anything that catches my eye\n",
